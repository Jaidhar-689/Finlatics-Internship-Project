## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **T-Series** ranks #1 with the highest number of subscribers.
- High correlation (**0.85**) between *subscriber count* and *total video views*.
- Very weak or negligible correlation between *education/unemployment* and *subscriber metrics*.
- **Average monthly and yearly earnings** were calculated using midpoints between estimated ranges.
- Country-specific factors influence channel distribution and performance.
